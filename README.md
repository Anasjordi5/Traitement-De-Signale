# Traitement-De-Signale
Main project: signal processing lab using Python to study sampling, spectra, aliasing, and ideal low‑pass reconstruction of multi‑sinusoidal signals via numerical experiments and plots.​  Travail supp: configurable spectral analysis tool that shows sampled spectrum, aliasing, and LPF‑recovered components for any chosen sinusoidal signal.
